django-expando
==============

A reusable Django app allowing model attributes to be assigned dynamically
similar to App Engine's built-in expando class.

Note: This is a very early publication of the source. The project will gain
the usual sugar files and comments once the design and implementation starts
to converge to maturity.

Please forward any related thoughts to Vlada Macek <macek@sandbox.cz>,
